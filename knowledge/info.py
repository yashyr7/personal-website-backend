# About Me

I am Yash Rathore, a software engineer specializing in mobile and full-stack development with a passion for building scalable, user-centric applications.

Served as the founding engineer for **Lock In**, a consumer productivity mobile app, owning the product from ideation to App Store launch. Led full-stack mobile development, backend integrations, and team execution while driving growth, scalability, and user engagement.

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo with experience building and shipping real products across startups and enterprise environments. My work spans mobile development, full-stack systems, and applied AI, with a strong focus on scalability, usability, and ownership.

I currently work as a Founding Flutter Engineer at an early-stage startup, where I led the end-to-end development and launch of a consumer productivity app. I owned mobile architecture, backend integrations, growth features, and internal tooling, while also leading an offshore engineering team. The app reached the Top-100 Productivity category on the App Store, surpassed 7,000 downloads, and drove meaningful user growth through features like a referral system and streamlined onboarding tools.

Previously, I interned at companies including DNAstack, Siemens (Enlighted), HomeX, and Bentley Systems, where I worked on enterprise data platforms, internal productivity tools, payment systems, and frontend performance improvements. These roles gave me experience working with large codebases, cloud integrations, observability, and automated testing in production environments.

Outside of work, I develop independent projects focused on applied AI and distributed systems, including AI-powered document analysis tools, real-time chat applications, task scheduling systems, and mobile apps that integrate OCR and LLM APIs. I enjoy owning problems end-to-end and building software that is both technically robust and genuinely useful.

# Courses and Licenses

## Machine Learning Specialization — Stanford University

I took the Machine Learning Specialization by Stanford University on Coursera to build a strong foundation in core machine learning concepts and practical techniques. I learned how to design and implement machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, evaluate and select models, and apply methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and clustering. The course also provided hands-on experience with real datasets, model tuning, and industry-relevant ML workflows.

## AI Engineer Agentic Track — The Complete Agent & MCP Course

I completed the AI Engineer Agentic Track on Udemy, where I learned how to design and build agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and take action beyond basic chatbots. Through hands-on projects, I worked with modern agent frameworks, single- and multi-agent workflows, tool and API integrations, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to structure agent interactions with external systems. The course emphasized production-style agent architectures and real-world business use cases.
